		      <p >I have been technically inclined since I could remember, been the only boy in my family, everything that has to do with electronics is always in my care from repairing to updating and making sure it works as expected. I learnt about programing language when I was in high school, I belong to a science and technology club (JET Club) where we get to learn about how computer and other machines works. I picked up interest in it and I continue building myself up on it.
						In college, I partner with a friend and we have a computer/software repair shop where we work on hardware and software, formatting and installing operating system, installing different kinds of programs, antivirus and hardware drivers even though I wasn’t a computer science student. We have both students and lecturers from the department of computer sciences as our client and even their professors.

		      <p>I came to the US after graduating college and it has been my dream to go fully into Information technology and while trying to do a little bit of research online about general IT I stumbled into front end web development(basically html) and I start to teach myself till I was confident, and I start to teach others. I help build my current church website where I worked as the web-content developer and administrator. 
						I decided to go further, that was why I enrolled into full Stack web-developer program which has thought and exposed me to things I wouldn’t have known by myself. Am willing to learn more as I am also doing my master’s in computer science at university of Illinois, full speed ahead not slowing down anytime soon. 
						I would love to work in an organization where I would be able to apply the skills that I have learned over the years and more so learn more by so doing.
